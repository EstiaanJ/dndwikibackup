Orbitals are large ring worlds, or halos, commonly called Orbitals. 
They are build such that if they rotate 360 degrees in 100k Seconds (~28h, 1 standard day) they will produce exactly 10m/s^2^ of acceleration (1 standard g-force) at their habital surface.
# Description
## Structure
An Orbital is constructed from segments called Plates. The Plates are constructed of ultradense, or exotic, materials. The inner surface of Plates are flanked by retaining walls called Edgewalls; the Edgewalls prevent the spinning Orbital's atmosphere from escaping.

A small space station called a Hub may be placed at the centre of the Orbital. The Hub typically contains the Orbital's governing authority.

Orbitals may be constructed with as few as two Plates. In these cases, the Plates are placed opposite one another and tethered to each other only by force fields; the combined structure is spun. The ring is completed by the incremental addition of Plate-pairs.

Orbitals come in varying sizes. Orbitals with diameters ranging from approximately one, to ten million kilometres existed. Plates may be thousands, even tens of thousands, of kilometres wide. Edgewalls may be thousands of kilometres tall. For instance, Vavatch orbital was said to be 14 million km long, and 35 thousand km wide, which would give it a diameter of about 4.46 million km and a usable surface area of about 490 billion km2 - over 960 times the surface area of the earth! 

## Surface Environment
Conditions on the inner surface are widely customizable.

Orbitals spin to create artificial gravity through centrifugal force, and to create a day-night cycle. Local day and night are produced whenever a given part the Orbital's interior is facing toward and away from the local star, respectively.

Additional mass is lowered onto Plates, altered, and shaped to create a variety of terrain; the volume between the Plate's inner surface and the surface of the terrain need not be solid, and may contain additional facilities. An Orbital may house multiple biospheres and biomes.

The weather may be manipulated using energy injection and fields.

A 3 million kilometre diameter Orbital may be populated by tens of billions of pan-humans with multiple Plates uninhabited.

## Facilities
The volume of the Plate below the inner surface is called the sub-Plate; access points between the surface and the sub-Plate are spread throughout an Orbital.

The outer surface of Orbitals and Plates is the underside. Spaceports are located along the underside. Long-distance transportation links may also run along the underside, using the vacuum to achieve high speeds

## The Culture
[[The Culture]] built Orbitals as mass-efficient ways of creating abundant living space. [[The Culture]] had been building Orbitals for millennia before the 22nd century CE.

The Culture constructed Orbitals from asteroids, comets, and other miscellaneous debris; a typical star system had enough of this material for at least one Orbital, and using them reduced collision threats to Orbitals. Material could be imported over interstellar distances as necessary. The Culture did not mine planets for building materials.

Space debris was also used to create the terrain on new Plates. Asteroids were lowered toward the surface and rendered molten by energy projectors - equivalent to planetary crust-busting weapons. The molten slag was shaped and distributed onto the Plate using other matter- and energy-manipulating processes.

[[The Culture]] considered 4 sextillion kilograms sufficient to construct an Orbital with a surface area of 10 billion square kilometres; the Orbital would have a maximum population of 50 billion.

Most Culture Orbitals in the 22nd century were 3 million kilometres in diameter.

The Culture's definition of an Orbital had a minimum size, and was for an unenclosed structure.

The typical ratio of land to water is 1:3. Wastelands and badlands were considered part of a balanced environment. Orbitals were spun to produce 1 standard gravity.

Most Culture citizens lived on Orbitals; this amounted to more than 95% of the population in the 29th century CE.

A [[Mind]] served as administrator for each Orbital. The Mind was housed in the Hub, and was typically addressed as same.

High-speed transportation across the Orbital was provided by the underside and sub-Plate network. Settlements were liberally provided with network access point; even isolated houses in rural areas could be provided with an access point. The underground cars used by the networks also served as lifeboats.

Complete Orbitals could be moved at superluminal speeds over interstellar distances; they had slow acceleration. 


## The Affront
The [[Affront]] received Orbital technology from the Culture within 500 years of the end of the [[Idiran-Culture War]]. The Culture hoped to reduce the Affront's reliance on planetary habitats and the Affront did not trust the Orbitals built for them by the Culture

# Additional Information by [Iain Banks](/Iain_Banks)
As indicated, the usual minimum for the width of an Orbital is about a thousand kilometres (two thousand if you count the sloped, mostly transparent retaining walls, which usually extend to five hundred kilometres or so above the plate land-sea surface). The normal ratio of land to sea is 1:3, so that on each Plate - assuming they are being constructed in the balanced pairs described above - a (very) roughly square island rests in the middle of a sea, with approximately two hundred and fifty kilometres from the shore of the land mass to the retaining walls. Orbitals, though, like everything else in the Culture, vary enormously. 

One thing almost every Orbital - whether just two Plates or a completed ("closed") Orbital - does have, is a Hub. As its name implies, the Hub sits in the centre of the Orbital, equidistant from all parts of the main circumferential structure (but not physically joined to it, normally). The Hub is where the Orbital's controlling AI (often a Mind) usually exists, running, or helping to run, the Orbital's transport, manufacturing, maintenance and subsidiary systems, acting as switchboard for trans-Orbital communications, library and general information point, traffic control for approaching, departing and close-passing ships, and generally working as the Orbital's principle link with the rest of the Culture. During the construction phase of a Plate-pair, the Hub will normally control the process. 

The design of a Plate sometimes incorporates the deep - or strategic - structure of the surface geography, so that the Plate medium itself contains the corrugations that will become mountains, valleys and lakes; more commonly, the Plate surface is left flat and the strategic structures on the inner surface - also constructed from Plate base material - are added later. Under either method, the Plate's manufacturing and maintenance systems are located within the indentations or hollows of the strategic structure, leaving the land surface free to assume a rural appearance, once the tactical geomorphology has been designed and positioned, the Plate's complement of water and air has been emplaced, the necessary weathering has occurred, and the relevant flora and fauna have been introduced. 

The surface of the Plate base is pierced by multitudinous shafts allowing access to the factory and maintenance volumes, and to the sub-surface transport systems. (Almost invariably, these include restricted single-aperture concentrically rotating airlocks paired in sequence.)

Existing on the outer surface of the base material, an Orbital's rapid-transport systems operate in vacuum, with the resulting advantages the lack of air-resistance confers; the relatively uncluttered nature of the Orbital's outer surface (whether flat, allowing the systems to operate next to that surface, or corrugated, requiring sling-bridges under unoccupied mountain indentations), means that the systems can be both high-capacity and extremely flexible. Journey starting-points and destinations can be highly specific for the same reason; an isolated house or a small village will have its own access shaft, and in larger conurbations a shaft will usually be within a few minutes walk.

Surface transport on Orbitals tends to be used when the pleasure of making the journey is itself part of the reason for travelling; air travel is common enough (if still far slower than sub-surface travel), though individual Plates often have their own guide-lines concerning the amount of air travel thought appropriate. Such guide-lines are part of one's manners, and not formalised in anything as crude as laws.
