**Schar's World** is a planet in [[the Milky Way]] near the [[Sullen Gulf]]. By the [[Idiran-Culture War]] it was a [[Dra'Azon]] [[Planet of the Dead]] with a [[Quiet Barrier]] radius of 310 standard light-days. By the [[Idiran-Culture War]] its Dra'Azon overseer was "Mr. Adequate"

# Ecology
The war which caused the [[Dra'Azon]] to claim the planet as a Planet of the Dead and the following ice age destroyed many of the indigenous species. By the [[Idiran-Culture War]], the remaining life included fish, but no mammals, in the seas, a hundred species of small insects, and lichen near the equator.

# Caretakers
The [[Dra'Azon]] allowed a small group of Involveds on the planet. By the Idiran-Culture War, the group was made up of four Changers with a pair being replaced every few years. Their base was inside an entrance to the Command System.The caretakers made a transmission off world at regular intervals. They were allowed two laser rifles and a few small pistols. They were not allowed anti-gravity harnesses.

The caretakers were officially allowed one inspection tour of the System each year. They would enter by the spiral tunnel from station four. During Horza's' tenure, the caretakers made a number of unauthorized sojourns into the Command System even going so far as to switch on the power. The Dra'Azon erased all data recordings made in the tunnels for all trips.

During one of Horza's trips the caretakers failed to activate the System's power properly. The resulting damage took weeks to repair. A similar accident occurred when inexperienced Idirans attempted to activate the power years later

# History
The indigenous [[Pan-Human|pan-human]] civilization reached the intermediate-sophisticated stage-three phase by 10000 BCE. At the time the state of the art weaponry included fusion warheads delivered by trans-planetary missiles. One nation state built a subterranean railway bunker, the Command System. The species completely destroyed itself using biological weapons.

1000 years after the extinction the [[Dra'Azon]] designated it a [[Planet of the Dead]]. 3000 years after that another periodic ice age started. The ocean surfaces froze except around the equatorial band.

During the [[Idiran-Culture War]], a [[Mind|Culture Mind]] in distress was admitted to the Planet of the Dead while fleeing the [[Idirans]]. It took shelter in the Command System The Idirans sent two forces to capture the [[Mind]]. The first took casualties after being shot down by Mr. Adequate The second was the [[Changer]] Horza who conscripted Kraiklyn's Free Company for transportation. In the resulting fracas the caretakers were all killed, and the two supposedly allied Idiran forces completed the destruction of the other. The only survivors were [[The Culture | Culture]] agent [[Balveda]], [[Unaha-Closp]], and the [[Mind]].

The planet was closed for the remainder of the war. The damage caused to the Command System during the fight for the [[Mind]] was totally repaired, and the remains and equipment left behind by the combatants and caretakers was compacted into a ball and buried under kilometres of glacial ice sheet near one of the poles. The [[GCU]] _Prosthetic Conscience_ and a [[Contact]] team was permitted to visit after the war for four days, after which the [[Quiet Barrier]] was closed forever.
