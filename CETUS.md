CETUS is a consortium of tech companies operating across multiple races and galaxies in the tech industry. Although these companies are competitors in the industry, they come together in galactic politics to further their agenda and acquire resources for their field. CETUS also facilitates research projects that would be too costly for individual companies to undertake. Members are able to purchase different levels of membership, with higher fees granting greater voting power within CETUS's democratic voting system.

CETUS was originally established on Earth in the late 21st century as the Consortium of Engineers for Technical Universal Standards. During the Earth Diaspora Crisis, it expanded its reach and became an Interstellar Guild, representing the interests of numerous corporations in low-tier and mid-tier civilizations. High-tier civilizations generally do not engage in inter-civilization trade, and thus, there is limited need for standardization
