After the self-proclaimed Merchant Lord Veniti took his fleet and separated from the [Guild of Interstellar Transport](/GIT) to go on with his own enterprises, he ended up forming the basis for what is now know across the stars as the Veniti Flotilla but informally just “The Flotilla". Dipping their hands in most and all sources of income without a care for how unsavoury it may pose to the wider intergalactic community, The Flotilla is run by 12 Merchant Princes that hold a vast sway over not only their own personal fleets, but entire worlds that conduct business with the Flotilla.

The leadership structure was setup so that no one merchant prince has more power than another with an elected Merchant Lord to act as the upholder of the virtues set out by Veniti centuries prior. This was a good setup in theory but the Merchant princes are as flamboyant and malicious as they are cunning and well-mannered. To vote in a Merchant Lord requires each prince to vote for their choice but since every prince would only vote for themselves the odds of a new Merchant Lord rising up in the Veniti Flotilla is understood to be an impossible outcome.

So the Merchant Princes work with the rules set by Veniti as more guidelines, with the grace to pick and choose when the right time is to conform or disobey. Whilst in charge of their own sectors of business, small squabbles and cold-wars are often fought between princes caught on the raw end of a proposal gone sour, with the opportunity for other princes to step in to profit or enforce order in the conflict.

Since the flotilla outright abolished the idea of having a single planet to anchor themselves to, they are completely space-born. The capital ships of the Merchant princes could be mistaken for space stations acting as space-faring cities that anchor in orbit and by design can be mistaken for a trading outpost or fortress given the circumstance. Being led by a group of warlords and aristocrats each in equal measure, each Merchant Prince has their own heraldry, colours, agents and code of ethics that varies with each new prince. The Princes knack for finery, wealth and elaborate business schemes are a few of the things that keeps them together as well as their use of Veniti’s seal which acts as the symbol for the Flotilla as a whole.

To deal with The Veniti Flotilla could bring the greatest riches or deepest despair. Contracts could be bound by blood, print and ones very soul should the Prince deem it so, one minute you are selling minerals, peddling weapons and then slaves without question, or hesitation. To negatively impact the vast profit margins of a Prince's treasury will only end in the chance to pray that the worst you get is a quick death.
