They were in the same volume of [[The Milky Way|Galaxy]] as the [[Affront]] and being more developed have managed to keep them in check. However, a century or so after the end of the Idiran War, the Padressahl decided to [[Sublimation|sublime]] into Advanced Elderhood, leaving the Affront free to roam.

They are the ones who gave the Affront their current name, initially intented as an insult but adopted eagerly by the Affront.
