The Vortai Government is separated into five bureaucratic and complex branches; these are the Branches Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Auditial and Corporate. 

The Executive Branch of the Vortai Government presides over the Vortai police force. This police force is utilised to prevent crime, punish those who have committed crime, and uphold laws and legislation created and implemented by the other branches of the Vortai Government. This police force is called the Vortai Law Enforcement Agency (VLEA). 

VLEA agents, sometimes colloquially (and derogatorily) called Fleas, are divided into various levels and sub-organisations. 

## ESO
The most common VLEA agents belong to the Enforcement Sub-Organisation (ESO) and are called ‘Lawmen’’. These low-level agents are usually found patrolling streets or ships in an effort to prevent crime as it happens, or deter it. 

## PACO
‘Detectives’ belong to the Post-Actuality Crime Organisation (PACO). These agents hold higher authority within the police force and are primarily utilised in solving already committed crimes. 


 
## PACPA
The Pre-Actuality Crime Prevention Agency is a small, highly secretive branch of the VLEA that uses various techniques to prevent high profile crimes from happening before they happen. It's largley a thankless job.

 
 
# JEDA
Whilst the Vortai police force may seem straightforward in how it operates, a surprising complexity does exist in how Vortai laws are enforced. A Vortai Law Enforcement Agent must uphold and comply with stringent rules, laws and regulations of which all branches of the government have a vested interest. These rules, laws, regulations and legislation are defined as ‘Codes’ by VLEA, and are organised in a numerical system. Not to mention. Vortai law is based on a coule of merged case law systems system with almost 10 000 years of case law legacy, and an almost seperate statutory law system which the legislative councile oversees.

 It is not uncommon for the various branches of the government to impose different interpretations of the laws onto VLEA. It is also not uncommon for conflicting interpretations to occur. For instance, the Corporate Branch may impose its authority as to prevent one of its members from being arrested by VLEA for crimes uncovered by the Auditial Branch, yet the Auditial Branch may impose its authority as to have the member arrested. 

In an effort to mitigate some of the bureaucracy (and possible corruption) issues that the VLEA may face, the Vortai Government long ago designed and implemented a hyper-computer super-program to navigate the complexity. Not a true Artificial Intelligence, this hyper-computer program is still truly near-inconceivably powerful. This hyper-computer super-program is designated ‘Judgment and Enforcement Determination Algorithm’ or ‘JEDA'. 



## JEDA Agents
Separate from the common Lawmen or Detectives that make up the majority of VLEA agents, an elite few exist to investigate and enact judgement on criminals of higher threat or importance. This sect of agents work with and, in some capacity, for, JEDA. 

Agents that work under JEDA jurisdiction are as follows:
Justicar (Clerics - Order Domain)
Provosts (Paladins - Vengeance)
Gendarme (Warlock - Celestial)
Enforcer (Barbarian - Zealot)

These VLEA agents are unique in that they are allocated, to varying levels, the use of 'Radiant Energy' as it is called by the Vortai (Known simply as grid energy, or photonic radiation originating from grid space, in The Culture). This Radiant energy is derived from the [Energy_Grid](/Energy_Grid). While using the Energy Grid is common in level 7 and 8 Civilizations to power ships and worlds, it's exceptionally rare for individuals to have access to it. Access in general on such a small scale is rare. The grid provides a powerful energy source that can be harnessed to empower allies or damage enemies. To some more undeveloped civilisations, this energy may be viewed as magic. 

Justicars are the highest rank of boots-on-the-ground agents available to VLEA. These agents are provided with near unregulated use of Radiant Energy. 

Provosts are a combat-specialist agents with a lower allocation of Radiant Energy than Justicar’s. Provosts also have higher regulations than Justicars, and thus can more easily be stripped of Radiant Energy (Paladin Oaths). 

Gendarme are unique in that they are usually members of a Branch other than Executive, and are thus empowered with technology granted by that Branch. Gendarme are allocated moderate usage of Radiant Energy, but nowhere near Justica level. 

Enforcers are allocated a very low amount of Radiant Energy. Primarily close quarters combat agents, Enforcers are primarily sent into the field when the guilt of the criminal is utterly unquestionable, and JEDA has deemed outright destruction the only valid action. 

To ensure unquestionable loyalty, complete absence of corruption, and lawful use of authority and power, JEDA is running constant algorithms and programs that assess VLEA agents. Whilst regular VLEA agents (Lawmen and Detectives) are still monitored and assessed by JEDA; Justicars, Provosts, Gendarme and Enforcers are highly scrutinised in all aspects of duty. 

JEDA gathers data and intelligence on VLEA agents via uploading of written reports (via data transference technology), as well as the transferral of recorded video/audio logs. Uploading of written reports and video/audio logs is non-negotiable and refusal will result in incarceration. 

# Independent Auditial Inquisition Agency (IAIA)
The IAIA is a fairly flat organization, consisting mostly of field agents who conduct investigations, managers to whom they report and a computer system that assists the Auditial branch in governing the IAIA, summerising its activities and reports. 

Agents of IAIA are often refered to Auditors and have the right to, at any time, enter any property beloning to any other law enforcment agency, private or government controlled, and go through their evidence, equipment and data. When auditors are not investigating other agencies or doing random checks, they often assist the VLEA in their invistigations. Somtimes Auditors conduct secret invistigations on crimes for the sole purpose to compare the results of the investigations against those conducted by the VLEA and the findings of the courts, to measure their accuracy.

Auditors don't exert a lot of force, nor do they carry weapons of any significant offensive capacity (as put by the IAIA) but an IAIA inqusition is feared by many in VLEA. The Auditors, being lone agents have an air of mystery and rumour around them.

Should a law enforcment agency not comply to a audit, as has happened on occasion in far off wolds with local police forces, the IAIA can call upon military resources to pacify the environment sufficiently for an investigation to occur.

Since the use of JEDA became prevalent about 300 years ago, the role of the IAIA has become ever more complicated. Some are calling for its dissolution while others are saying it ought to be investigating more than just law enforcment. In practice the IAIA still has value in its investigations on private law enforcment agencies which are the dominant source of law enforcment on the outskirts of Vortai space, and in keeping an eye on JEDA.
