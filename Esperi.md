# Esperi
**Esperi** is a star located in the [[Upper Leaf Swirl]] portion of the [[The Milky Way|Milky Way]] galaxy.  By the late [[1800 CE|19th Century CE]], Esperi had become an old red giant that had swallowed its inner planets leaving only a couple of distant icy worlds and a remote cloud of comet nuclei. The system contained no life.
