The Z’Tran are an aquatic race. They live in salt water, and their homeworld is 80% ocean. When the Z’Tran explore outside their world they have to wear special suits that keep their bodies from dessidication, keeps the right balance of minerals especially salt, and the suits feed water into their gills so that they can respirate. They govern their worlds through a feudal system. The Z’Tran value Chivalry immensely.  The Z’Tran have for centuries worshiped the beings of immense size and power that reside on their planet. These beasts, though primitive, are a true force of nature and nothing stands in their path.  Having a single religion for almost all of their history makes the Z’Tran unique amongst the known sentient inhabitants of this [[The Milky Way|galaxy]], most having a plethora of diverse religions. They are also rare in that not many religions gets to actually see the beings they worship; There’s no doubt that the deep ones exist, only doubt that they are “gods”. The Z’Tran have only recently in the last decade become a secular sovereignty. Finally allowing for open worship of other entities or even atheism.
