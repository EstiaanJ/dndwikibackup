# Exameter
A common unit of measure on galagtic scales, the [The_Milky_Way](/The_Milky_Way) is about 946 Exameters across

A state of the art culture civilian ship can travel around 90 Exameters in a year sustained, crossing the milky way in around 11 years or so (without the use of [Mass_Relay](/Mass_Relay)).
That is 2.8 million kilometers per second, which is 9.5 x C (Speed of light in m/s)
A state of the art culture war ship can travel around 105 Exameters in a year sustained (Much faster in bursts).

Andromeda is about 23,700 exameters from the milkyway, it would take around 263 earth years to reach it with current state of the art technology.
