# Contact Offline Encyclopedia
This is the Contact Offline Knowlege Database. Contained within is a small subset of all the encycopedia pages that Contact has on various topics. If there's something you're looking for that is not available offline, please make a request here: [Document Request](/Document_Request)

Please do not share the information within this database with people outside The Culture.


## How To Use This Wiki
### Tips
- Use the tags page to search for pages by tag. For example, if you want to see a list of planets click on the planets tab. If you want to see a list of articles about The Culture's tech, click on the culture-technology tag.
- Use the search bar above at the top of the wiki! It can search for pages but also for words in pages. In the near future it will receive an upgrade to be more smart about how it searches.
- If you can't find what you're looking for, see [Document Request](/Document_Request)
> Text that is in a blue information box like this is out of character. The rest of the text, within reason, is verbatim, cannon, in game text. It's a wiki that exists within the game itself.

> If you write stuff for the wiki, try to write it in character, though keep in mind wikis are supposed to be neutral, maybe your character cares about that... If you write information OCC, write it in a box like this

## HELP NEEDED
You can help! If you have editing rights, wherever you see things like this [[some text]]
you can help by creating a link to the page mentioned in the "some text" part using the editor.
> In general creating pages about the stuff you learn in-game will be useful to us all
For editing rights I will need an email address
