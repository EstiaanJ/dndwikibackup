# Wabbokombor
Wabbokombor (Wabba) are a rare and unique species on Troria, known for their large size and unique abilities. They are a beetle-like species that measure over 3 meters in length, with a dark brown exoskeleton that is adapted to blend in with the grassy fields of Troria.

Wabbokombor are herbivores, feeding on the grasses and other plants that grow on Troria. Despite their large size, they are nimble and agile, able to move quickly and gracefully across the grassy fields. They have also evolved a unique ability to teleport short distances, which allows them to evade predators such as Xalyte and Moidilios.

Due to their large size, abilities and armour, Wabbokombor are not typically hunted by Xalyte, as they are too difficult of a prey. However, they are still a rare species, with a small population that is vulnerable to poaching for their valuable t-matter. As such, Wabbokombor are a prized and protected species on Troria, and efforts are being made to conserve their population and protect their unique abilities.
