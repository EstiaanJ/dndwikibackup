The **Sublimed** are alien civilizations in who have left the known dimensions of space time behind ("subliming") to take up residence in several higher dimensions. These higher dimensions seem to lack many of the constraints on the development of complexity found in our four dimensions.

Individuals and [Minds](/Mind) are capable of subliming, and this is described as an ever-present temptation for beings that are bored with or tired of the limited space and time as we know it.
