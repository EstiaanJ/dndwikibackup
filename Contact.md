# Contact
Contact is the section of [[the Culture]] responsible for foreign interaction and military matters. 

# Activities
Contact is the part of the Culture concerned with discovering, cataloguing, investigating, evaluating and - if thought prudent - interacting with other civilisations. It handles almost all interactions between the Culture and elements non-Culture. It is a relatively small part of the Culture and most normal citizens would never encounter a Contact agent or ship.

[[The Culture]]'s modus operandi, rather than encourage immigration or wholesale incorporation of other civilisations, is to instead subtly guide less advanced civilisations to fulfil their potential, often by secretly influencing politics and wars via the Contact section. When it is deemed appropriate, Contact handles the transition of individuals, groups or indeed whole civilisations into the Culture.

Contact also oversees the voluntary departure of citizens from the Culture to the civilisation of their choice and remove any unfair technological or informational advantage the citizen in question may use against its new peers, when deemed appropriate.

During the [[Idiran-Culture War]], Contact acted as the Culture's armed forces. Purpose built Culture warcraft were rare in the early years, and were substituted by [[General Contact Vehicle]]s and General Contact Units. These ships were heavily engaged and outnumbered.

Contact's fleet represented a second line of defence for preserving the Culture. The first line consisted of large habitats ([[Orbital|Orbitals]], Rocks, etc..), with the last being the Oubliettionaries. 

# Oranizations
Contact containes specialist sub-divisions. The Numina, Quietus, and Restoria divisions were formally created during a reorganization during the 3rd millennium CE

## Numina
Numina dealt with the [[Sublimed]]

## Quietudinal Service
The Quietudinal Service, or Quietus, dealt with virtually extant, if physically dead, entities, such as those residing in Afterlives.

## Restoria
The Restoria section dealt with hegemonising swarm outbreaks. Its mission included the management, amelioration, and destruction, of hegswarms. The section was nicknamed "Pest Control".

# Contact & The Culture
Contact is a relatively small part of the whole Culture, however, and the average Culture citizen will rarely encounter a GSV or other Contact ship in person; the craft they will normally have the most to do with are cruise ships; interstellar passenger vessels transporting people from habitat to habitat and visiting the more interesting systems, stars, nebulae, holes and so on in the locality. Again, this type of tourism is partly long-term fashion; people travel because they can, not because they have to; they could stay at home and appear to travel to exotic places through what we would now call Virtual Reality, or send an information-construct of themselves to a ship or other entity that would do the experiencing for them, and incorporate the memories themselves later.
