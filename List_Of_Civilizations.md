> Civilization is probably not the right word to use here, perhaps polity or sovereign state, something like the interstellar equivilent of nations. It's too late though, the word Civilization is used all over the wiki in this context.

[1] CETUS are a bit hard to categorize, something between a corporation, a congromorate of corporations, a standardization committee, a sovereign state and a guild. CETUS does maintain a territory consisting of a handful of solar systems as a sovereign space which it governs in a mananer that that represents an interstellar civilization, has ambassadors in other civilizations and has embassies in it's own space. For these reasons it is included on this list.
