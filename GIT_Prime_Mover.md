The standardized cargo ships for moving cargo in [[The Milky Way|the galaxy]]. >90% of these ships are owned by the [[Guild of Interstellar Transport|GIT]] and leased out to various entities.

# The Culture
[[The Culture]] maintains and crews it's own fleet of prime movers which are still mostly owned by the [[Guild of Interstellar Transport|GIT]]. If a citizen or oganization of the culture whishes to move something within the culture they need only register the interest on the online system and they will be given space on a prime mover without charge, however, depending on the size of their cargo, or the frequency of their requests, they may need to wait. 

Many [[Inolved]] have a deal with the culture whereby cargo is freely exchanged between those societies, thus meaning a citzen of the culture would not need to pay in such a scenario either.
