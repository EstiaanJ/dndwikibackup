Real space (or the Real) is the three-dimensional domain of a universe containing [[Baryonic Matter|baryonic matter ]] and the conditions to create life.

# Skein

The skein is how real space appears in [[Hyperspace|hyperspace]]. The skein is a two-dimensional plane representing space-time. It is also the surface of a hypersphere, with the [[hyperspace]] within being infraspace and ultraspace being that without.

# Warping

A warp is a disturbance on the skein. [[Gravity Well|Gravity wells]] create warps. They may be artificially induced, such as by [[Warp Unit|warp units]], for a variety of purposes.
