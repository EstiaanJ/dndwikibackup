A hyper-grid intrusion (or gridfire) is the channelling of the [[Energy Grid|energy grid]] into real space. It has a blindingly white appearance.

A similar effect may be achieved by crash-stopping from high speeds while using [[hyperspace]] propulsion.

# History 
By the [[Idiran-Culture War]], both the Culture and the Idiran Empire had sufficient expertise with the grid to form gridfire.[2]

Novalevel gridfire was used by the [[GSV Eschatologist]] to destroy [[Vavatch Orbital]] during the [[Idiran-Culture War]]. The oribital was uninhabitated and intentionally destroyed to prevent it falling into Idiran hands.

The [[Dra'Azon]] used a weapon resembling gridfire to enforce the [[Quiet Barrier]] around a [[Planet of the Dead]].

Gridfire was not witnessed in [[the Milky Way]] for at least 500 years after the Idiran-Culture War.
