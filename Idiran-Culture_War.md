The [[Idiran]]-Culture War was a conflict between the [[The Culture|Culture]] and the [[Idiran Empire]] that officially spanned from 1327 CE to 1375 CE. The result was the dissolution of the [[Idiran]] Empire. It was regarded as a small and short war that [[involved]] .02% of the [[The Milky Way|galaxy]]'s volume and .01% of the population. Nonetheless from a historical perspective it was the most significant conflict of the previous 50 thousand years

# Pre-war events
The war followed a series of escalating disputes between the Culture and the Idirans that preceded it by 150 years. The first dispute was in 1267 CE. The second in 1288 CE saw the Culture construct its first warship, in prototype form, in 500 years in 1289 CE.

The third in 1307 CE resulted in machine fatalities. The discussion of the possibility of open war caused the Peace Faction to split from the Culture proper. The situation was temporary defused by the mutual withdrawal of forces arranged by the Anchramin Pit Conference.

Armed conflict erupted again in the fourth dispute of 1323 CE. Initially only Culture proxies were actively engaged against the Idirans. The Culture's War Council of 1326 CE saw more parts of the Culture renouncing violence and splitting away. The following year, the Idiran-Culture War Conduct Agreement was ratified and the war officially started with the direct engagement of Culture units and personnel.


# The War
The war starts and Homomdan involvement

Contrary to Culture expectations, the Homomda joined the war in a limited capacity on the [[Idiran]] side in 1332 CE.

The Culture fell back during the early stages. The Idirans found it difficult to locate and attack the distant nodes of Culture war production, and were forced to subdue the often uncooperative lesser civilizations abandoned by the Culture's retreat. Several war-irrelevant Culture [[Orbital|Orbitals]] were attacked, some instances resulting in several billion deaths, but these strikes only stretched the Idiran military further.

The key Culture combatants during this time were the General Contact Units. The GCUs were grossly outnumbered but superior field technology made them individually superior. GCUs bore the brunt of the fighting for the first four years of the war.

At the end of the first stage, the Culture completed the changeover to war production to support a growing and augment a fleet of dedicated warships.

# Aftermath

With the Idiran Empire defeated, the Culture resolutely returned to its pre-war disposition. The majority of its war fleet was scrapped during the post-war demobilization, with a relative few retained disarmed, or [[Stored]]. Within 200 years the number of its active warcraft fell below pre-war numbers.

The same determination to return to peacetime activities also affected Culture foreign relations. In the immediate post-war period, the Culture rejected the option to affect major change to the Affronter polity through a short and sharp war; as a result the Affront became a long term problem for Culture foreign policy.

Millions of Culture citizens went into [[Storage]], with the instructions that they were to be revived when the Culture proved that the war was morally justified. The "proof" was the peaceful passage of time over which it was probable more people would have died from Idiran Empire expansion than from the war. The criteria was fulfilled in 1813 CE.

The Homomdan polity maintained its civilizational course after the war, even though the war did not achieve its desired goal. Over time, the Homomda discovered the Culture to be a reasonably responsible member of the galactic community, and the two developed an amiable relationship.

Not all Idirans accepted the victors. Some committed suicide. Others went into exile; the Homomda took in and employed some exiles, but refused to aid further attacks on the Culture; some fled to little-known parts of the Magellanic Clouds, or to the Andromeda Galaxy. A few joined the Culture, or entered the Culture's employ.
