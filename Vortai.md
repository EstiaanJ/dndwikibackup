The Vortai Galactic Republic, sometimes [Vortai](/Vortai) or Vorti for short, are a civilization comparable to the size and power of The Culture.


## Government
  
The Vortai main world and other planets under direct control are ruled by a Geniocracy, meaning their leaders have to qualify as near geniuses before they are democratically elected through a [Direct_Democracy](/Direct_Democracy). The level of entry to be a candidate for selection is a lot smaller for lower positions than for higher positions. For example the local government of a city won’t have that strict a barrier of entry, but the supreme leader is definitely required to be a polymath genius. Furthermore the Vortai’s system of government is incredibly complex, bureaucratic and inefficient.


### Horizontal Seperations
The Vortai Government is separated horizontally:

-   Executive Branch
	-   Military
	-   Police
	-   Soveriegn Security and Intelligence
	-   Partial Audition of Auditial branch
-   Legislative Branch
    - Making of laws
    - Funding of other branches
- Judicial Branch
    -  Courts
    - Interpretation of laws
    - Partial Audition of Auditial branch

-   Auditial Branch
	-   Investigation and supervision of all other government branches and levels
	-   Examines and checks the qualifications of members and potential members of government
	-   Vets current and new members of government for criminal backgrounds or association with criminal entities or enemies of the state.
    
-   Corporate Branch
		The corporate branch is so called because many of the governmental agencies it oversees are in fact publicly traded companies where this branch acts as and in place of the usual board of directors.
	-   A catch all for governmental organizations and agencies like:
		-   Environmental protection authority
		-   Internal Intelligence Agency
		-   Intergalactic Trade Administration
		-   Galactic Spaceflight Agency
	-   Headed by a council that oversees the appointment of the heads of each agency, funding, establishment and dissolving of agencies.
