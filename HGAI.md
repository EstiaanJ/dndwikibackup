These AI were created to think exactly like humans do, they have a simulation of the human brain.   Most HGAI seek to have the two civilizations re-joined and for humans and HGAIs to be treated equally. A lot of humans still doubt the HGAIs’ claim of sentience and think of them as machines or imitations that don’t feel or suffer.

They are able to reproduce by having two parents’ brains go through a process where random traits are selected to be passed on such that 50% of the child’s brain is from each parent, with each of the billions of traits having a slight chance of mutation. A new body for the mind is then manufactured.

Since the HGAIs can control what their body looks like they have over time made themselves look more human and less machine.

HGAI were originally computers in robotic frames that simulated pan-human brains
