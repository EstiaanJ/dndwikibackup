A mostly addative manufacturing device that can assemble objects based on a plan which is specified down to an molecule exact scale. Meaning, in critical areas, precision can be specified down to the exact positions of molecules relative to other molecules. In less abstract terms, these devices can 3d print any shape or assemblies of shapes. Complete, working objects can be assembled in a matter of seconds: For example: [neural laces](/neural_lace), guns, personal computers, musical instruments, food and so on. An object that a ordinary person would need can be produced by a MA, and over 90% of the things an ordinary person could need can be produced by a 3d Printer or Food Assembler.

# MA Classes
MAs exist in a variety of size. In the Culture, typically each world has a few hundred MAs that can print things about 50m cubed in size distribuited across the world in pseudo-industrial areas. Medium sized ones that can print things roughly 5m cubed exist in the dozens in each city, and small MAs that can print things as large as 300mm cubed exist in each community. Each household, typically, has a couple of related item called a 3d Printer and a food assembler, which is are less capable addative manufacturing tools.


# Addative Economics
Due to the wide spread access to addative manufacturing, there is very little transport of ordinary goods (goods that can be manufactured by MAs) between worlds, cities or even housholds in The Culture. One just creates the objects one needs. Instead, the raw materials that these devices used are transported instead. Even the raw materials can be produced by large industrial centers if needed.

In the culture this also means that there is essentially no viable market for goods other than raw materials, even if her citizens did have access to money.

In other level 7 and 8 civs that have MAs and money, typically patterns are exchanged for money instead of whole objects. Once a person or organization obtains the pattern for something, they can produce as many of said item typically, only paying for the pattern, the raw material and the energy required. Other patters have a royalty system, each print charges a fee. Some patters can be rented, others are one use only.
