# Header
The **[[Excession]]** **at Esperi** was a massive object of unknown origin and capabilities discovered around the star [[Esperi]] in the [[Upper Leaf Swirl]]

# Physical Appearance
The Esperi Excession was a near-perfect black-body antimatter sphere, with a stippled granular surface,orbiting the red giant star Esperi in the Upper Leaf Swirl. It was 53.34 kilometers in diameter. Despite its size it had no apparent mass, and left no indentations on the skein of space-time, giving the first impression of being a projection of sorts. Later the Excession was discovered to be "connected" to both ends of the [[Energy Grid]]. This was something the Culture was not able to do, and so they took immediate interest. Connection to the grid could imply the ability to traverse the grid and travel to both older and younger universes which lay beyond the layers of energy.
