An ablationary plume occurs when a ship's field engines fail to connect effectively with the [Energy Grid](/Energy_Grid) during a rapid acceleration, for evasion or an escape attempt. Instead of exploding or being damaged, the engines ablate, or burn away, to absorb the energy impact, slowing the ship and causing significant damage to the engines. A complete engine overhaul is required. The bright and visible plume created can serve as a visible distress signal, which can be seen from a significant distance. In peacetime, this is considered an embarrassing situation, while in war it could result in fatal consequences.
