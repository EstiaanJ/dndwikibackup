# The Galactic Republic Confederation

The GRC is a Level 8 [Involved](/Involved) Civilization. The GRC is a collection of Member States over-which it rules as a Confederation, meaning a union of sovereign states, and as a wide spanning inter-stellar economic alliance and peackeeping mission. Some member states are well defined regions of sovergenity while others species that are somewhat, but not totally localized. 

# GRF vs GRC
Some peoples are wholly governed by the GRC simply as citizens of the GRC. Likewise some star systems belong to the GRF alone and not to any other Sovereign state. In this way the GRF is also a Sovereign state as well as being a union of other Sovereign states. Sometimes these people and territories are refered to as the GRF, Galactic Republic Federation, the original founding members, peoples and territories of the GRC.


The GRC are both a sovereign state and a politcal, strategic and economic uninon. Parties of the GRC are called Member States and vary from being fully governed by the GRC (Very much willingly) to being distant economic allies and/or co-signers on a few of it's many intra-galactic, unifying, motions. For example the [Asari Civilization](/Asari_Civ) are officially a Member State but maintain their own sovereignty, while the [Drell](/Drell) are also a Member State and do not maintain their own sovereignty
