# Technology
The radio system uses a variety of techniques to communicate tactial data, voice and text between squad members while exposing as little data as possible to enemy combatant.

If you can see your squad members the radio will typically default to a low power precisily focused uv laser, which accuratly tracks and points at each team member's radio to transmit data. This means an enemy couldn't intercept the transmission, or even be aware of it, unless they physically stand inbetween, or very close to being inbetween, you and your team member.

> As a player, all you need to know are the ranges, and for the most part it doesn't really matter much how the radio works or what range applies except for very rare circumstances 
{.is-info}


In air or vacuum:
 - LOS: 10km
 - Not LOS: 1km
 Underwater:
 - LOS: 100m
 - Not LOS: 50m
 - Within 1m of surface: Same as "In air or vacuum"
 
In addition to these ranges, friendly STDC radios can relay your message instantly to all friendly team members within range of _that_ radio. In this way you can use a teammate to contact someone who is out of range for you, but not for your teammate.
