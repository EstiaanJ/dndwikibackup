# Contact Unit
A **Contact Unit** is a type of multi-purpose [[The Culture|Culture]] spacecraft. A related development was the **Contact Vehicle**.

# Types
In addition to [[General Contact Unit]] (GCU), there were General Contact Vehicles ([[General Contact Vehicle|GCV]]); GCVs occupied the area between large Contact Units and small [[Systems Vehicles]]

The smallest Contact Unit built by the 24th century CE was the [[Scree-class Limited Contact Unit]]  Relatively few were built; the [[Mind|Minds]] of the _Scree_-class were regarded as "guaranteed to go a bit mad" due to the extremely small crew size of five. By contrast, an _Escarpment_-class General Contact Unit of the late-20th century CE carried a crew of 300, and the GCU _[[Grey Area]]_ of c. [[1800 CE|19th century CE]] was designed for a crew of 300.


# Description

Contact Units were equipped with [Contact](/Contact) procedures and equipment, which enhanced their information gathering capabilities. GCUs could perform a full scan of a planetary civilization within a few months, in addition to despatching [Contact](/Contact) personnel for low-level reconnaissence.

Though not designed as warships, GCUs were nevertheless well armed and capable of very fast travel. GCUs were considered able to "waste planets."

A degree of eccentricity was expected from the [Minds](/Mind) of GCUs by their crews.

# History
The _Troubadour_-class, an early class of GCU, was in service by c. 6th century BCE. 

GCUs bore the brunt of the fighting during early years of the [[Idiran-Culture War]] as more dedicated [[warcraft]] were constructed.

In the mid-20th century CE, a "million or so" GCUs were extant. Approximately ten thousand of these were constructed by the _Infracaninophile_ manufactory at Yinang Orbital.
