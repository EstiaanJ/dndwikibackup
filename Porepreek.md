## Porepreek 
Porepreek are 1.5m tall quadraped herd animals. They are herbivores that eat the grass of the grassy plains. Porepreek are also capable of photosynthesis and a smaller varierty exist in the desert biomes (Porepreek minor) which mainly rely on photosynthesis. They are technically the same species, but stand only 0.8 m tall as an adult. Porepreek have small antenna like eyes that can poke out above tall grass when they are laying down, allowing them to see preditors or shifting grass while remaining hidden themselves.
