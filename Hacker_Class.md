# Modder
As a student of cyber-augmentation, you have learned to master and use a wide range of high-tech equipment and hacking techniques. You have incorporated these tools into your own body, becoming a formidable force in the digital world.

### Cyber Skills
A cyber skill is a minor hacking effect you
have mastered. At 1st level, you know one
cyber skill of your choice. You learn
additional skills of your choice at higher levels.
The Skills Known column of the Hacker table
shows the total number of skills you know at
each level; when that number goes up for you,
choose a new skill.

### Cyber Points
You have an internal reservoir of energy that can
be devoted to hacking techniques you know. This
energy is represented by cyber points. Each hacking
technique describes effects you can create with it
by spending a certain number of cyber points. A
cyber skill requires no cyber points.
The number of cyber points you have is based on
your hacker level, as shown in the Cyber Points
column of the Hacker table. The number shown
for your level is your cyber point maximum. Your
cyber point total returns to its maximum when you
finish a long rest. The number of cyber points you
have can’t go below 0 or over your maximum.

## Mods and Tools
Mods and tools are the backbone of a modder’s abilities. They are the physical enhancements and hacking programs that you have integrated into your body. Mods and tools were each developed by different organizations and tend to reflect their creators’ areas of expertise. However, a modder can learn and integrate any mod or tool regardless of its associated organization.
