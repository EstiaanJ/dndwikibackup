# Chelgrians
The Chelgrians are a mammal-like [[Involved]] species native to Chel. 


The civilisation known as the Chel occupy a unique position in relation to [[Sublimation]]. When they attained the technological know-how for this step, only part of their civilisation sublimed and, when they did, they created a "*heaven*". Based somewhat on the existing Chelgrian religion, this (technological) "heaven" was somewhere to which individual Chel could sublime after death (via a device known as a *[[SoulKeeper]]*). Furthermore, unlike (most) other sublimed civilisations, the sublimed Chel continued contact with non-sublimed Chel in the material universe, and would occasionally interact with them (for example, in the righting of wrongs or attendance at sporting events). Chelgrian-Puen (the 'gone before') are the gatekeepers of this "heaven". The cause of this strong bond between the sublimed and non-sublimed Chel is believed to lie with the caste system at the heart of their culture.
