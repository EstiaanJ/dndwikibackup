# 1/Rnd
*If you are using it alone:* It takes an entire round (that includes movement, action, bonus and reaction) to load the gun, that does not include fireing it which takes an attack action

*With an assistant:* It requries a bonus action, reaction and action split in whatever way between the gunner and assistant, to load the gun. It still requires an attack action to fire. 

Either way the gun can only be fired once per round

If a creature inside the radius is the target of a continuing spell, that spell is interupted but continues on after 10 seconds 
The EMP has a selectable trigger either it goes off when it impacts something, or it goes off 10 seconds after thrown.
The EMP will also damage or effect electronics at the DM's discretion
## Frag
