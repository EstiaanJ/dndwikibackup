Human-like species that share a common DNA ancestory, possibly created by, or geneticly related to, the [[Prometheans]]

The term Pan-human describes a large group of roughly humanoid species with similar characteristics, originating from many worlds across the galaxy


# Physiology
Although there is considerable variation among species, the standard pan-human bodyplan is bipedal and upright, with two arms and two legs, hands and feet with several digits each, and a head where the brain, mouth, respiratory and primary sensory organs (typically two eyes, two ears and a nose) are located.

As of the 20th century CE, most pan-humans breathe oxygen

Pan-humans from different planetary origins are genetically distinct and cannot interbreed, but the pan-humans in the Culture are typically genetically modified to allow for interbreeding.

# Demographics
Pan-humanity is spread widely across the Milky Way and they make up less than one percent of the total life-mass of the galaxy.
