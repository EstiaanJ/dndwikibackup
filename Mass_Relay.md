Mass Relays are mass transit devices scattered across the Milky Way, usually located within certain star systems. They form an enormous in size galaxy-wide network enabling rapid interstellar travel between select points. Hailed as one of the greatest achievements of the now extinct Protheans, a mass relay can transport starships instantaneously to another relay within the network, allowing journeys that would otherwise take years or even centuries with only FTL drives to occur in only a handful of days, or even hours. 

# Overview
## Specifications
Mass relays consist of two fifteen-kilometer (or nine-mile) long curved metal arms surrounding a set of revolving, gyroscopic rings five-kilometers across. These rings contain a massive, blue-glowing core of element zero. The relays are made of an unknown but incredibly resilient material, and are protected by a quantum shield that renders them nearly impervious to damage by locking their structure in place at the subatomic level. Similar but different to the fields that keep [orbitals](/Orbital) structurally intact. They are even capable of surviving a supernova's wake without any damaging effects. They are "cold" objects that don't emit any form of heat or radiation, unlike starships, making them difficult to find if their position has changed over time. Some relays, like the Charon Relay, are "gravitationally anchored" to celestial bodies; others appear to be out in space and are carefully tracked. 

Mass relays function by creating a virtually mass-free "corridor" of space-time between each other. This can propel a starship across enormous distances that would take centuries to traverse, even at FTL speeds. Before a vessel can travel, the relay must be given the amount of mass to transit by the ship's pilot before it is moved into the approach corridor. When a relay is activated, it aligns itself with the corresponding relay in the network before propelling the ship across space. At the other end, vessels have no specific exit points, emerging randomly around the relay with positional "drift" of many thousands of kilometers being common. It would thus take an impractical amount of time to mine or trap a relay effectively.
