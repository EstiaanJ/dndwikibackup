Hyperspace is the fourth-dimensional space of [[Meta-Space|meta-space]].


# Infra Space and Ultra Space
Infraspace(or inferior hyperspace) and ultraspace (or superior hyperspace) describe portions of hyperspace relative to the [[Skein|skein]] of a particular [[Universe|universe]]| .

When a universe is created, its [[skein]] is the surface of a hypersphere. Hyperspace within the sphere is infraspace, while that without is ultraspace. Therefore, hyperspace extends beyond the [[energy grid]] boundaries of a universe.

For universes with typical life-cycles, the [[Cosmic Centre]] births younger universes into the infraspaces of older universes. 

# Perspective from hyperspace

The energy grid appears as an uneven curved plane from hyperspace.

Three-dimensional [[real space]]–the skein–appears as transparent plane. Objects in real space also appear as two-dimensional objects. Stars and supernovae are readily noticeable on the skein. Black holes appear as tornadoes reaching toward the energy grid.

Most real space objects have minimal effects on hyperspace, although entering hyperspace close to real space objects may be dangerous.

The energy grid and the skein appear as surfaces curving to the horizon; the curvature is reminiscent of, but not as pronounced as, that experienced in a planetary environment. The curvature reflects the fact that a universe is the surface layer of a larger hypersphere. 

# Uses

Light travels faster in hyperspace than in real-space; hyperspatial light is not infinitely fast. This is used in hyperspatial communication.

The flatness of the skein may be used by hyperspatial sensors to look inside real space objects. Similarly, objects in hyperspace may be moved inside real space objects by first moving underneath the real space object in hyperspace.

Hyperspace also facilitates [[FTL|superluminal propulsion]] and computing.
