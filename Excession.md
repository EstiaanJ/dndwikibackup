# Excession
An excession is a pejorative Culture term, sometimes used by Culture-ulterior groups like the Zetetic Elench. It is used to describe things which are dangerous to an excessive point.

It is also used to describe things which apear to be breaking the known laws of physics


**"Excession; that was what the Culture called such things. It had become a pejorative term and so the Elench didn't use it normally, except sometimes informally, amongst themselves. Excession; something excessive. Excessively aggressive, excessively powerful, excessively expansionist; whatever. Such things turned up or were created now and again. Encountering an example was one of the risks you ran when you went a-wandering."** â€” Dn. Sisela Ytheleus 1/2, _Excession._
