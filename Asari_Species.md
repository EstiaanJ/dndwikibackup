The Asari, native to the planet Thessia, are often considered the most influential and respected species outside of [The Culture](/The_Culture) and are known for their elegance, diplomacy, and [Biotics](/Biotics) aptitude.

A mono-gender race, the asari are distinctly feminine in appearance and possess maternal instincts. Their unique physiology, expressed in a millennium-long lifespan and the ability to reproduce with a partner of any gender or species, gives them a conservative yet convivial attitude toward other races.

Favoring compromise and cooperation over conflict, the asari were instrumental in proposing and founding the Galactic Council of Inolved Civilizations, as well as an early member species of The Culture (Most Asari live in Asarian society and not in [The Culture](/The_Culture), but some live in The Culture).

# Biology
Asari resemble humans in terms of basic skeletal structure with five digits on each hand and feet that are relatively straight.

This similarity allows asari to wear human armor. A typical asari has a blue to purple complexion, though a teal complexion is possible albeit seemingly rare. Some Asari have facial markings, which are unique colored patterns that vary for every asari. Some of these facial markings resemble the eyebrows that humans have, but the asari do not think of the markings as such themselves.
