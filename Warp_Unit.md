A **warp unit** is a device that creates a warp field, a field that distorts space and reduces the distance between you and your target. This distortion does not have large effects on the world around it and is hard, but not impossible, to detect

# Propulsion
Warp motors are units purpose-built as reactionless drives that propel objects along the [Skein](/Skein). Ships use motors for [faster than light](/FTL) travel.

Warp propulsion leaves a wake. Warp crash-stops are inherently inaccurate.

Motors become more dangerous to use as they get deeper into a gravity well. Active motors may be damaged by skein shockwaves caused by warp charges.

Units meant for personal use may be known as warp attachments.

Warp propulsion is less advanced than [hyperspace](/Hyperspace) propulsion.
