The Culture is a major [Involved](/Involved) polity in the [Milky Way](/The_Milky_Way) galaxy. It is an informal association of sapients unified by shared values and a hedonistically-oriented lifestyle enabled by technology. The Culture relies heavily on [Mind](/Mind) for administration and planning.

# History
The Culture is a loose federation founded by space-faring elements of several [Pan-Human](/Pan-Human) species in the 76th century BCE. They seek mutual support to maintain their independence from their mature origins. A conference was held approximately 70 years prior to 8023, according to the Koweyn calendar, with representatives from the Buhdren Federality and the Gzilt civilization in attendance. The [Glitz](/Glitz) ultimately declined to join the Culture and the proposed name for the new polity was "the Aliens".

## Territory

The Culture's territory encompasses its member ships and [habitats](/Orbital), which are spread throughout the galaxy. There is no contiguous Culture volume as its elements are either mobile or dispersed. Planets make up a minor part of the Culture's holdings as orbitals provide more living space for the investment. Terraforming planets is considered undesirable due to its ecological impact.

## Society

### Conventions and Behaviour

The Culture operates without formal [Culture Law](/Culture_Law) and behavior is regulated by social norms and conventions. Poor behavior is discouraged through the threat of ridicule and ostracization by one's peers. Insulting "punishments" can include not being called by one's chosen name. Breaking taboos can result in pariah status, but not eviction from the Culture.

Making an unbidden in-depth scan of someone's brain without permission is considered taboo and equivalent to mind reading. [Minds](/Mind) view this as a way of honoring their biological creators.

Murder, defined as causing total brain death or personality loss, is the most serious taboo in the Culture. Murderers are offered therapy and may be assigned a "slap-drone" to prevent future occurrences. Preventative assignment of slap-drones is also sanctioned.

Important or eccentric ships may be assigned shadowing ships as a form of "slap-droning."

### Governance

The Culture operates as a kind of social anarchy where citizens enjoy total individual freedom, within reason, while maintaining internal social cohesion. This results from the mutual dependence required for survival in the hostile environment of space. Space-faring habitats must often be self-sufficient, freeing them from the control of states or governing bodies and granting independence from each other. The hostile nature of space and the reliance on technology for life support makes the inhabitants aware of their dependence on each other.

Politically, the Culture operates as a [Direct Democracy](/Direct_Democracy) where anyone can call for a referendum on almost any subject at any time. Deciding which citizens are eligible to vote can itself become a hotly debated issue, leading to multiple referenda about who can vote in on the main issue. The electorate can range from a small group to the entire Culture, but each citizen has one vote regardless of other factors.

Executive power is typically held by Minds, which encompass superior intelligence and have technical control over infrastructure as they are embodied within ships and habitats. Minds require no outside assistance to run ships and habitats. The general population can communicate directly with local Minds at any time. Elected bodies representing the general population to Minds are also used as alternate avenues and as safeguards against potential widespread personal manipulation by Minds. On the whole, election to these bodies is honorary, although they serve a variety of ceremonial and liaison functions. Liaisons between Minds and the general population can also be chosen on a rota basis.

Minds of good reputation have a great deal of freedom to act within accepted norms. Decisions made by Minds can be challenged and reversed with the support of special interest groups. These groups offer counsel and create public awareness, thus exerting social pressure.

Minds form ad-hoc groups to address large crises and select one member, typically a large unit like a Systems Vehicle, to organize meetings and facilitate communications as the "incident coordinator." Decision-making in these groups is democratic.

### Names

Culture citizens typically have names that consist of multiple parts, which together act as an address of sorts, describing their birth star system, family name, estate or house of raising, given name, and chosen name. In everyday use, the name is usually truncated to just the given and family name.

On the other hand, Minds and the ships they inhabit usually choose names that reflect their personality, attitude, or sensibilities. These names are often frivolous or humorous, sometimes indicating an acerbic wit, such as "Space Monster" or "Ultimate Ship The Second". Warship names are often cynical and threatening, such as "Gunboat Diplomat" or "Falling Outside The Normal Moral Constraints", or ironically innocuous, such as "Resistance Is Character-Forming" or "Frank Exchange Of Views".

# Foreign Relations

The Culture's approach is to subtly guide other civilizations to reach their full potential, rather than through immigration or wholesale incorporation. This is often accomplished by secretly influencing politics and wars through the Contact section. When deemed appropriate, Contact manages the transition of individuals, groups, or even entire civilizations into the Culture.

[Contact](/Contact) is responsible for discovering, cataloging, investigating, evaluating, and, if deemed necessary, interacting with other civilizations. It handles almost all interactions between the Culture and non-Culture elements. It is a small part of the Culture, and most regular citizens are unlikely to ever encounter a Contact agent or ship.

Contact also manages the voluntary departure of citizens from the Culture to other civilizations, and interferes if necessary to remove any unfair technological or informational advantage that a departing citizen may have.

# Economy

The Culture is a post-scarcity polity, and is materially self-sufficient. It has ubiquitous and distributed productive capability whose capacity exceeds conventional material needs. Raw materials and energy are readily available from interstellar sources. The Culture experiences a universally high standard of living.

Money is not used and is regarded as unnecessary and inefficient for the purpose of distributing general goods and services. Ironically, the adoption of quasi-money can spontaneously occur in response to the limited availability of temporary products; this "money" can take the form of trading and "banking" favors. Occasionally culture citizens will use the money of other top level players, such as the 

Manufacturing and maintenance are completely automated. "Work" and "labor" exist only as vehicles for personal fulfillment and enjoyment, and are more akin to hobbies.

# [Culture Genetics](/Culture_Genetics)

Basically everyone born in The Culture carries the results of genetic manipulation in every cell of their body; it is arguably the most reliable signifier of Culture status. These genes come from a fad of genetic engineering the culture went through in its early days.

Thanks to genetic manipulation, the average Culture human will be born whole and healthy and of significantly (though not immensely) greater intelligence than their basic human genetic inheritance might imply. There are thousands of alterations to that human-basic inheritance - blister-free callusing and a clot-filter protecting the brain are two of the less important ones mentioned in the stories - but the major changes the standard Culture person would expect to be born with would include an optimized immune system and enhanced senses, freedom from inheritable diseases or defects, the ability to control their autonomic processes and nervous system (pain can, in effect, be switched off), and to survive and fully recover from wounds which would either kill or permanently mutilate without such genetic tinkering. 

  
The vast majority of people are also born with greatly altered glands housed within their central nervous systems, usually referred to as 'drug glands'. These secrete - on command - mood- and sensory-appreciation-altering compounds into the person's bloodstream. A similar preponderance of Culture inhabitants have subtly altered reproductive organs - and control over the associated nerves - to enhance sexual pleasure. Ovulation is at will in the female, and a fetus up to a certain stage may be re-absorbed, aborted, or held at a static point in its development; again, as willed. An elaborate thought-code, self-administered in a trance-like state (or simply a consistent desire, even if not conscious) will lead, over the course of about a year, to what amounts to a viral change from one sex into the other. The convention - tradition, even - so far is that each person should give birth to one child in their lives. In practice, the population grows slowly.

# Aging

Humans in the Culture normally live about 1100 to 1300 standard years (350 - 400 Earth Years). The majority of their lives consists of a 10 standard century plateau which they reach in what natural humans would call mid-twenties, after a relatively normal pace of maturation during childhood, adolescence and early adulthood. They age very slowly during those one thousand hundred years, then begin to age more quickly, then they die

# Funerals

The most common form of funeral involves the deceased - usually surrounded by friends - being visited by a Displacement Drone, which - using the technique of near-instantaneous transmission of a remotely induced singularity via hyperspace - removes the corpse from its last resting place and deposits it in the core of the relevant system's star, from where the component particles of the cadaver start a million-year migration to the star's surface, to shine - possibly - long after the Culture itself is history
