# Spell Changes
**Detect Magic - Detect EMF**
For the duration, the technology/ability allows the user to sense the presence of electromagnetic fields (EMF) and electromagnetic radiation within a range of 30 feet. If detected, the user can use it to identify the source and strength of the EMF and radiation. If you sense EMF or radiation in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that emmits the radiation, and you learn the type of radiation or EMF as well as the frequency.
> In game terms, the spell works the same way when it comes to spells or magic affecting other creatures, and magical objects, but there might be minor differences since for the spell to work the object or creature must be emitting EMF or EMR. In other-words, if it's not electronic it won't have an aura, and if it emmits a lot of EMF it will be a beacon. This makes the spell more powerful in some ways and less in other ways.
