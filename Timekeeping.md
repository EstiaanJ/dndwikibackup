# Galactic Standard Time
Everyone who uses GST abides by these rules. It's important to understand that, when using the GST system, it's the same time everywhere (within reason, accounting for lightspeed). Meaning there are no time zones. People wake up and go to sleep at different GST times depending on where they are on a planet or orbital, or what schedule the ship abides by.

> If it's 7 AM where you are, it's 7 AM everywhere. It might be the middle of the night for you because of where you are on a planet, and so, it might be time for you to go to sleep, but it is none-the-less 7 AM. Keep in mind though GST doesn't use hours, the 7 AM is just to put it in an earth perspective.

## Standard Second
The second is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency, ΔνCs, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom, to be 9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s^-1^ (exactly 1 earth second, or roughly 1/86400th earth days)

## Centisecond
A common, though informal, unit of time for pan-humans, a centisecond is 100 seconds, or about 1 earth minute (1.67m)

## Standard Kilosecond
A kilosecond is a common unit of time for pan-humans, it's about 1/2 an earth hour. (0.278 h)

## Standard Day
A standard day is 100 000s, usually refered to as 100 kiloseconds
A kilosecond is about 1/2 an earth hour, 100 kiloseconds are about 28 earth hours.

## Standard Year
A standard year is 10 000 000 seconds, (10 million, 10 Megaseconds) which is 100 Standard Days.
That is about 116 Earth days (115.74)

## Galactic Standard Kilo Year
The GSKY is not only an expression of the year in short form, but it is also the standard date and time format. A full date is expressed as follows:
GSKY 31.618 - 28 - 31.935
Meaning it's year 31,618, we're 28 days into the year, and 31,935 seconds into the day.
- Kiloyears - standard days - kiloseconds
- Once we reach 100.000 Ks, the day ticks over.
- Once we reach 100 days and 100,000 seconds, the year ticks over.

Often when refering to historical eras, one uses limited precision. For example GSKY 12.1 would refer to anything between 12.05 and 12.15, 12,050 years and 12,150 years since epoch

Dates before the epoch are expressed with a negative year.
