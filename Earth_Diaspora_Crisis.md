# Earth Diaspora Crisis
During the [Century] [[Earth]] was over-run by mass comersialization and huge corporations that involved themselves in every aspect of human life. As many people became indebted servants owing more money than they could ever earn, and gaining debt on interest at a higher rate than their income, a breaking point came where people started to leave Earth to escape their dept. As Earth were the youngest space faring civilization at the time, many people left Earth just to be taken advantage of by other [[Low-Tier]] civilizations. The Culture decided that [[Earth]] were advanced enough for aid (see [[Culture Intervention Policy]]), and thus opening its doors to Earth dept refugees.
