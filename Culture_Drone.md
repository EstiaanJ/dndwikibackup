# Culture Drone
Drones are autonomous or semi-autonomous machines that often serve as the physical housing for AIs. They are what less advanced civilisations might call "robots".

Independent drones - those of individual, human-equivalent intelligence - are considered fully sentient and enjoy the same rightsÂ as human [[The Culture|Culture]] citizens and [[Mind|Minds]]. Non-sentient drones are used in the Culture as machines, often controlled by AIs or Minds, for a wide variety of purposes such as construction, manual labour, serving Culture citizens, and warfare. Drones are considered genderless in the Culture, taking the personal pronouns "it" and "they".

# Appearance
Culture drones take on a variety of shapes and sizes depending on their occupation or role within society. Members of [[Contact]] tend to have a plain, functional appearance, like a grey or metallic suitcase, allowing them to blend in to alien civilisations as required. Normal citizens' appearance vary from the mundane to the ornate, sometimes comprising materials such as porcelain and precious stones.

Many Culture drones make use of an aura field, a visible colouration which they used to communicate their mood, equivalent to human facial expressions and body language.

# Communication
Being machines, drones can communicate electronically by means of transceiver. In [[the Culture]], it is considered polite for multiple drones who were communicating this way in public to position themselves into a lattice-like arrangement.

# Fields
Drones use a number of field technologies, including anti-gravity and maniple, to interact with the world around them in lieu of physical appendages. Maniple fields can be used to emulate a wide range of physical characteristics, effectively allowing drones to touch, feel, and manipulate matter down to the micrometer scale.
