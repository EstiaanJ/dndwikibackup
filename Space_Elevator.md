# Space Elevator
A space elevator, also referred to as a space bridge, star ladder, and orbital lift, is a type of planet-to-space transportation system. The main component is a cable (also called a tether) anchored to the surface and extending into space, with one end attached to the surface near the equator and the other end attached to a counterweight in space beyond geostationary orbit (35,786 km altitude for Earth). The competing forces of gravity, which is stronger at the lower end, and the upward centrifugal force, which is stronger at the upper end, would result in the cable being held up, under tension, and stationary over a single position on Earth. With the tether deployed, climbers (crawlers) repeatedly climb up and down the tether by mechanical means, releasing their cargo to and from orbit. The design permits vehicles to travel directly between a planetary surface to orbit, without the use of large rockets. 

Space elevators' thethers for many planets need to be made out of some the highest specific tensile strength materials available.  Due to the immense tensile load it must carry on many planets, only heavily engineered materials like ultra long carbon nano tubes (ULCNTs) will have a tensile strength - to weight - ratio that is good enough for a space elevator thether. The load comes from the sheer length of a 600 odd km long cable being stretched from both ends by gravity and centripedal force.
