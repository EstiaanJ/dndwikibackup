# Space Elevator
A space elevator, also referred to as a space bridge, star ladder, and orbital lift, is a type of planet-to-space transportation system. The main component is a cable (also called a tether) anchored to the surface and extending into space, with one end attached to the surface near the equator and the other end attached to a counterweight in space beyond geostationary orbit (35,786 km altitude for Earth). The competing forces of gravity, which is stronger at the lower end, and the upward centrifugal force, which is stronger at the upper end, would result in the cable being held up, under tension, and stationary over a single position on Earth. With the tether deployed, climbers (crawlers) repeatedly climb up and down the tether by mechanical means, releasing their cargo to and from orbit. The design permits vehicles to travel directly between a planetary surface to orbit, without the use of large rockets.
