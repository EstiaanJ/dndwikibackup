A hyperspacial aggregation motor (or field engine) is a spacecraft propulsion device allowing for faster-than-light travel in hyperspace. The motor functions by using engine fields to gain "traction" on and push against the energy grid.

Larger motors perform disproportionately better relative to smaller motors.

Motors are constructed of exotic material.

HMs are more advanced than [[Warp Unit]]s

## Operations
Fast spacecraft tend to have a larger proportion of their mass devoted to motors.

Care needs to be taken when engaging motors deep within a gravity well.

A high speed crash-stop produces a disturbance in the energy grid; the unleashed energies can break through the skein–into real space–in a manner similar to a gridfire.

Intergalactic speeds are much slower than intragalactic speeds. The energy grid is more "tenuous" outside galaxies, making it more difficult for engine fields to gain traction.

A failed attempt to gain traction when "hitting the ground running" causes an energy backlash. In such a scenario, motors are designed to bleed off the energy by partially ablating; the ablation is visible to long-range sensors as an ablationary plume. The motors are disabled, and the spacecraft slowed. Without ablation the spacecraft would be seriously damaged or destroyed.
