Exotic materials are materials made from matter which is not baryonic in nature.
These materials exhibit unuasual behaviour and are extremely rare. In addition to being rare, it's diffcult to use most exotic matter in an [addative manufacturing](/addative_manufacturing) method, making goods that require exotic materials rare and expensive.
