A Mind is a sapient entity, a very sophisticated AI able to traverse [[hyperspace]] at will. They are also able to independently transition from the Real to Sublime, and possibly return to the Real as roughly the same entity.

# The Culture
Minds are the de facto leaders of [[the Culture]]. They are analogous to the brains of spacecraft when embedded.

## Structure
The [[real space]] shell of a Mind is a ten metre long and two metre wide ellipsoid. The computational and memory components are particularly dense and are located in [[hyperspace]]. An internal [[warp unit]] is used to expand the memory space. Power is provided internally. Several field generators could be used for propulsion. The entire Mind has a mass of around 15000 tonnes.

## Computation and Memory
he cognitive functions of a Mind takes place in both three-dimensional and four-dimensional space. Three-dimensional operations rely on picocircuitry and photons and results in significantly inferior performance. Memory is stored in binary in the form of neutrons and protons. When operating in three-dimensional space the neutrons decay into protons; memory is preserved but rendered unusable by wrapping it in fields.

As they grew, Minds "wrote their own operating system", such that each Mind's functionality is unique, and hacking/compromising one does not make it any easier to compromise others.

## Personality
A Mind's personality is influenced by the premise-state used during its creation. The personality may be shaped to better suit the Mind's intended role. For example, Minds intended for warcraft are developed to have a soldierly attitude toward martial action.

## Relationships
Minds can have quasi-familials relationship with "child" Minds they helped create, with children possibly giving additional weight to the opinion of their parent. One strategy when making requests of difficult Minds was to route the requests through its parents.
