<p>Basically everyone born in The Culture carries the results of genetic manipulation in every cell of their body; it is arguably the most reliable signifier of Culture status. These genes come from a fad of genetic engineering the culture went through in its early days.</p>
<p>Thanks to genetic manipulation, the average Culture human will be born whole and healthy and of significantly (though not immensely) greater intelligence than their basic human genetic inheritance might imply. There are thousands of alterations to that human-basic inheritance - blister-free callusing and a clot-filter protecting the brain are two of the less important ones mentioned in the stories - but the major changes the standard Culture person would expect to be born with would include an optimized immune system and enhanced senses, freedom from inheritable diseases or defects, the ability to control their autonomic processes and nervous system (pain can, in effect, be switched off), and to survive and fully recover from wounds which would either kill or permanently mutilate without such genetic tinkering.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>The vast majority of people are also born with greatly altered glands housed within their central nervous systems, usually referred to as 'drug glands'. These secrete - on command - mood- and sensory-appreciation-altering compounds into the person's bloodstream. A similar preponderance of Culture inhabitants have subtly altered reproductive organs - and control over the associated nerves - to enhance sexual pleasure. Ovulation is at will in the female, and a fetus up to a certain stage may be re-absorbed, aborted, or held at a static point in its development; again, as willed. An elaborate thought-code, self-administered in a trance-like state (or simply a consistent desire, even if not conscious) will lead, over the course of about a year, to what amounts to a viral change from one sex into the other. The convention - tradition, even - so far is that each person should give birth to one child in their lives. In practice, the population grows slowly.</p>

<h2>Slow Aging</h2>
<p>Humans in the Culture normally live about 1100 to 1300 standard years (350 - 400 Earth Years). The majority of their lives consists of a 10 standard century plateau which they reach in what natural humans would call mid-twenties, after a relatively normal pace of maturation during childhood, adolescence and early adulthood. They age very slowly during those one thousand hundred years, then begin to age more quickly, then they die</p>
