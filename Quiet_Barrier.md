A **Quiet Barrier** is the interdiction zone surrounding a [[Dra'Azon]][[Planet of the Dead]]. The radius of the zone is usually half the distance from the Planet's primary to the nearest star.

Barriers also made it difficult for external [[hyperspace]] sensors to scan their volumes. During the [[Idiran-Culture War]]the [[The Culture|Culture]] was unable to get any [[hyperspace]] readings from outside the Barrier.

Intruders entering a Barrier may be attacked with an effect resembling [[gridfire]]. Technological equipment may be destroyed even if survivors manage pass through the Barrier and crash land on the planet.
