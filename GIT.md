They represent the transportation industry in faction politics. There are a few [[Mass Relay|mass relays]] that are held by them. The transportation guild is a guild that was formed by the major players in transport for both the alien alliance and the human alliance and some other third alien alliances while the first contact war was going on, the alliance effectively ended the war in the name of commerce as companies belonging to the alliance, 90% of transport companies, refused to transport military goods. The guild offers plenty of benefits for being a part of it, but a requirement of membership at the time of the first contact war was that you refuse to transport anything on the “blacklist” (A list of military goods). The only exception was when an individual pilot or crew were threatened they were allowed to transport to preserve their lives. As a result the price of transporting military goods skyrocketed, and those who were not a part of the guild made a substantial profit, but the war ended quickly when the people of both races, following the example of the GIT, made their voices heard in protest. The GIT also offered transport for medical equipment at no profit during the war.
