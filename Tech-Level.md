# Levels

## Level 1
Can manufacture Steel

## Level 2
Industrialization and early computer technology

## Level 3
No interstellar travel though space capable towards the end of level 3.
Usually not aware of the Involved.
Once a civlization begins expanding to new solar systems it signals that they are at the end of level 3 and the Inolved establish first contact. However a minority of civilizations are contacted by non-involved interstellar civilizations before they reach that point.

## Level 4
Interstellar capable (Warp drive or not) and communication with the Involved are key markers of a early level 4 civ.

Towards the end of level 4 a civilization becomes Involved

## Level 5

## Level 6

## Level 7
Hyperspace propulsion & Molecular Assembly
Exotic and Meta Material mastery

## Level 8
High Level Involved
    The Culture, c. 14th century CE[5]
    Nauptre Reliquaria, 29th century CE[5]
    The Gzilt
    The Homomda
    
## Beyond Level 8
In the known history of the galaxy only one civlization has significantly progressed into what might be considered a next level. The [Prometheans](/Promethean) had the ability to build [Mass Relay](/Mass_Relay) and no civilization since has figured out how to build mass relays or how to achieve negative mass using the mass effect, though many [Level 8](/Tech-Level) civilizations are capable of activating mass relays and creating other technology that use [Mass Effect Fields](/Mass_Effect_Field)
