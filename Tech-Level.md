# Levels

## Level 1
Can manufacture Steel

## Level 2
Industrialization and early computer technology

## Level 3
No interstellar travel though space capable towards the end of level 3.
Usually not aware of the Involved.
Once a civlization begins expanding to new solar systems it signals that they are at the end of level 3 and the Inolved establish first contact. However a minority of civilizations are contacted by non-involved interstellar civilizations before they reach that point.

## Level 4
Interstellar capable (Warp drive or not) and communication with the Involved are key markers of a early level 4 civ.
Warp drives are the most common FTL mechanism for Level 4 Civs
Towards the end of level 4 a civilization becomes Involved

## Level 5
Subspace communication is a key marker of level 5


## Level 6


## Level 7
Hyperspace propulsion & Molecular Assembly
Exotic and Meta Material mastery

## Level 8
Energy Grid access marks a civilization as being level 8

High Level Involved
    The Culture, c. 14th century CE[5]
    Nauptre Reliquaria, 29th century CE[5]
    The Gzilt
    The Homomda
    
## Beyond Level 8
In the known history of the galaxy only one civlization has significantly progressed into what might be considered a next level. The [Prometheans](/Promethean) had the ability to build [Mass Relay](/Mass_Relay) and no civilization since has figured out how to build mass relays or how to achieve negative mass using the mass effect, though many level 8 civilizations are capable of activating mass relays and creating other technology that use [Mass Effect Fields](/Mass_Effect_Field).

Many Elder Civlizations are close to the end of level 8 and have access to technology that, for instance, The Culture does not fully understand.


# Notes and Considerations
General Artificial Inteligence and Sentient Artificial Inteligence are notably missing as technological milestones because:
- AI tends to come up at different times for different civlizations
- Once AI arises there tends to be an exponential climb in technological progress and in particular AI technology. Growth is especially explosive when AI start imrpoving themselves more quickly than the creators could. See [GAI Explosion Filter](/GAI_Explosion_Filter)
