# Levels

## Level 1
***Medieval***
Can manufacture Steel

## Level 2
***Industrial***
Industrialization and early computer technology

Typical Technologies:
- Steam Engines
- Early Electricity
- Internal Combustion Engines
- Mechanical Computers

## Level 3
***Information Technology***
No interstellar travel though space capable towards the end of level 3.
Usually not aware of the Involved.
Once a civlization begins expanding to new solar systems it signals that they are at the end of level 3 and the Inolved establish first contact. However a minority of civilizations are contacted by non-involved interstellar civilizations before they reach that point.

Typical Technologies: 
- Spacecraft
- Aircarft
- Fusion (Sometimes)
- GAI (Sometimes)
- Living Domain Robotics (Robots roughly the size of the species)
- Computers
	- Digital
 	- Quantum
  - Analog - Light Computers
- Early Laser weapons and Railgun Kinetic Weapons
  

## Level 4
***Low Level Involved - Interstellar***
Interstellar capable (Warp drive or not) and communication with the Involved are key markers of a early level 4 civ.
Warp drives are the most common FTL mechanism for Level 4 Civs
Towards the end of level 4 a civilization becomes Involved

Typical Technologies:
- Sublight Warp Drives
- Cryogenic Hybrination
- Early FTL
- Anti-Matter Energy & Weapons
- Fusion
- Laser Weapons & Railgun Kineitics

## Level 5
***Low Level Involved - FTL***
Subspace communication is a key marker of level 5
Substrate computing


## Level 6
***Mid Level Involved - Fields***
Field Technology is a key marker of Level 6
Subspace Computing

## Level 7
***High Level Involved - Total Post Scarcity & Advanced FTL***
Hyperspace propulsion & Molecular Assembly
Exotic and Meta Material mastery

## Level 8 
***High Level Involved - Arbritary Energy Access***

Energy Grid access marks a civilization as being level 8
    The Culture, c. 14th century C
    Nauptre Reliquaria, 29th century CE
    The Gzilt
    The Homomda
    
## Beyond Level 8 - Intergalactic Travel, Hyperspace Master & Sublimation
In the known history of the galaxy only one civlization has significantly progressed into what might be considered a next level. The [Prometheans](/Promethean) had the ability to build [Mass Relay](/Mass_Relay) and no civilization since has figured out how to build mass relays or how to achieve negative mass using the mass effect, though many level 8 civilizations are capable of activating mass relays and creating other technology that use [Mass Effect Fields](/Mass_Effect_Field).

Many Elder Civlizations are close to the end of level 8 and have access to technology that, for instance, The Culture does not fully understand.


# Notes and Considerations
General Artificial Inteligence and Sentient Artificial Inteligence are notably missing as technological milestones because:
- AI tends to come up at different times for different civlizations
- Once GAI arises there tends to be an exponential climb in technological progress and in particular AI technology. Growth is especially explosive when AI start imrpoving themselves more quickly than the creators could. See [GAI Explosion Filter](/GAI_Explosion_Filter). In practice this climb is more of a logistics curve (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function)

The levels are soft boundaries and many technologies cross over on when they are achieved. Warp drives for instance are FTL capabale mechanisms but many level 4 civs don't have warp drives that can actually exceed the speed of light, merely aproaching it, while others can only go 2 or 3 times the speed of light. A level 5 Civ meanwhile will aproach the upper limit of Warp Drive's physical capabilities and reach speeds of just over 10C using warp drives.
