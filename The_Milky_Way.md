The galaxy is a place long lived-in, and scattered with a variety of life-forms. In its vast and complicated history it has seen waves of empires, federations, colonisations, die-backs, wars, species-specific dark ages, renaissances, periods of mega-structure building and destruction, and whole ages of benign indifference and malign neglect. At the time of the Culture, there are perhaps a few dozen major space-faring civilisations, hundreds of minor ones, tens of thousands of species who might develop space-travel, and an uncountable number who have been there, done that, and have either gone into locatable but insular retreats to contemplate who-knows-what, or disappeared from the normal universe altogether to cultivate lives even less comprehensible. 

# Space Faring Citizens
About 12% of the Milky Way is in some way claimed as territory
- This does not mean 12% of stars are inhabited
	- Only around 8000 stars have a population in the local system of over 100 000 people and are thus considered inhabited. 
		- Stars with fewer people are typically areas of interest with temporary accomadation such as research facilities, military holds or mining operations

Number of space faring citizens
- Roughly 300 trillion
